# **caesar-cipher**
The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The provided Python code includes functions to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

**Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption**
- The caesar_cipher_encrypt and caesar_cipher_decrypt functions now include docstrings to provide detailed explanations of their purpose, parameters, and return values.

* The ASCII offset is determined based on the case of the letter (uppercase or lowercase), and the Caesar Cipher shift is applied accordingly.

+ The main function's docstring explains its purpose, which is to allow the user to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
